**Distributing WPA hash cracking.**

Management tool for WPA hash cracking with a distributable software including WebUI.

In order to crack a WPA hash you must upload a valid handshake in *.cap* format to the WebUI.
The agents software runs the password list in a distributed manner, more agents will result in a faster scan procedure.
